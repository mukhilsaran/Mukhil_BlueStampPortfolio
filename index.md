For your final milestone, explain the outcome of your project. Key details to include are:
- What you've accomplished since your previous milestone
- What your biggest challenges and triumphs were at BSE
- A summary of key topics you learned about
- What you hope to learn in the future after everything you've learned at BSE

For your second milestone, explain what you've worked on since your previous milestone. You can highlight:
- Technical details of what you've accomplished and how they contribute to the final goal
- What has been surprising about the project so far
- Previous challenges you faced that you overcame
- What needs to be completed before your final milestone--> 

# First Milestone

For my main project, I chose the Wall-E robot. I chose it because it gives my a well-rounded experience on the mechanical, electrical, and the software side. The Wall-E robot has two 8x8 LED matrices for eyes, an ultrasonic sensor, a LCD screen, and 4 servo motors (two micro, and two regular). For my first milestone, I have wired up all the eletrical components and tested them by making the servos move, making the LEDs light up, the LCD to display a message saying "Hello", and the ultrasonicc sensor by making it print the output on the serial monitor. After testing all of the components, I will be writing the final code for the project, assembling the body of the robot, and securing the electrical components into the designated compartments of the 3D printed body. A few difficulties when working on my project werere with my LED matrices. I was confused as to how I was supposed make patterns, and writing the test code for the rest of the components was also hard.

  For my starter project, I went with the handheld arcade. I chose this project because I thought it was fun to use and it was also portable. This handheld arcade uses 2 8x8 LED Matrices and an LCD screen to display the game and scores respectively. It has foour arrow buttons to navigate and play games, and two more to slect and cancel. It is powered by 3 triple A batteries that make it capable of being used anywhere. Its features include A selection of five different games, adjustable brightness, and adjustable volume.

# Schematics 
![MainProjectSchematics](Screenshot 2024-06-13 215404.png)

<!--- Here's where you'll put images of your schematics. [Tinkercad](https://www.tinkercad.com/blog/official-guide-to-tinkercad-circuits) and [Fritzing](https://fritzing.org/learning/) are both great resoruces to create professional schematic diagrams, though BSE recommends Tinkercad becuase it can be done easily and for free in the browser. 

# Code
Here's where you'll put your code. The syntax below places it into a block of code. Follow the guide [here]([url](https://www.markdownguide.org/extended-syntax/)) to learn how to customize it to your project needs. 

```c++
void setup() {
  // put your setup code here, to run once:
  Serial.begin(9600);
  Serial.println("Hello World!");
}

void loop() {
  // put your main code here, to run repeatedly:

}
```

# Bill of Materials
Here's where you'll list the parts in your project. To add more rows, just copy and paste the example rows below.
Don't forget to place the link of where to buy each component inside the quotation marks in the corresponding row after href =. Follow the guide [here]([url](https://www.markdownguide.org/extended-syntax/)) to learn how to customize this to your project needs.

# Other Resources/Examples
One of the best parts about Github is that you can view how other people set up their own work. Here are some past BSE portfolios that are awesome examples. You can view how they set up their portfolio, and you can view their index.md files to understand how they implemented different portfolio components.
- [Example 1](https://trashytuber.github.io/YimingJiaBlueStamp/)
- [Example 2](https://sviatil0.github.io/Sviatoslav_BSE/)
- [Example 3](https://arneshkumar.github.io/arneshbluestamp/) -->
